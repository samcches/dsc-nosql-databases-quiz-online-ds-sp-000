    "# NoSQL Databases - Quiz\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll try our luck with some common open-ended interview questions about NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the difference between a NoSQL and a SQL database?  Which is better?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In a NoSQL database, the schema and structure are designed before the database are created, in a way that is meant to accomodate extremely large datasets and the calculations intended to be performed with them. For relatively small databases, SQL is fine; but, for databases with hundreds of thousands of data points, NoSQL is better.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe a situation where a NoSQL database might be a better choice than a relational database, and explain your reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a large department store with many branches wants to find out which products are selling best across all of its departments and stores, a NoSQL database would take less processing time and therefore be better.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "How does MongoDB work? How is it different from a relational database?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is a document store. Although it is easier to store data in a document store than in a relational database, it is more difficult to query the data as each document can have its own schema. Each document stored in MongoDB or any other document store contain key-value pairs wherein the data is stored as the value. In a relational database, on the other hand, the schema is far more restrictive, with each document required to have the same keys as other documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "What is fault tolerance, and what does it have to do with Resilient Distributed Datasets?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Fault tolerance is the RDD's way of making sure that all data from all servers are acessible at any given time. Making backups of each section of the database on each server on which the database is stored ensures that if the server(s) fails, the data is still available for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "What is MapReduce? How is it related to Hadoop?\n",
    "\n",
    "Write your answer below this line: \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "MapReduce is how RDDs like Hadoop run queries functions on multiple locations at once and then combine the results into a single aggregate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we reviewed some common NoSQL interview questions. "
